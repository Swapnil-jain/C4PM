Interviewer: What's not working for you?

Rachel: Notifications are broken. I set up alerts for delayed shipments and they fire randomly. Sometimes I get 50 alerts in a minute for the same shipment. Sometimes critical delays get no alert at all.

Interviewer: How does this affect you?

Rachel: I've turned off alerts entirely. Which defeats the purpose. Now I manually check the dashboard every hour because I can't trust the system.
