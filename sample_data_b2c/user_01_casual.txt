Interviewer: Tell me about your experience with our fitness app.

Maria: I downloaded it because my friend recommended it. The first few days were okay, but then I just... stopped opening it. I forget it exists honestly.

Interviewer: What made you stop using it?

Maria: There's no reminder or anything. I set a goal to work out three times a week, but the app never nudges me. By Thursday I realize I haven't opened it since Monday.

Interviewer: Did you try the notification settings?

Maria: There are notification settings? I didn't even know. The app has so many menus, I only use like two screens. The home screen and the workout screen. Everything else is confusing.

Interviewer: What would bring you back?

Maria: Something simple. Like my friend texts me "hey did you work out today?" - that works. But the app feels like homework. I want it to feel like a friend checking in, not a to-do list.

Interviewer: What about the social features?

Maria: I didn't know there were social features. Is there a way to work out with friends? That would be amazing. I'd actually use it if I could see my friend's progress or do challenges together.
