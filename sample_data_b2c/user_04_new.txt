Interviewer: You just started using the app. How's it going?

Kevin: Honestly, overwhelming. I opened it and there's like a million options. Custom workouts, programs, challenges, social feed, shop... I just want to know what exercises to do today.

Interviewer: Did you try the recommended programs?

Kevin: There's like 50 of them! "Beginner Strength" "Beginner Hypertrophy" "Beginner Full Body" "5x5" "PPL" - I don't know what any of that means. I'm a complete beginner. I need ONE option that says "do this if you've never lifted before."

Interviewer: What did you end up doing?

Kevin: I watched YouTube videos and made my own workout. Which kind of defeats the purpose of the app? I'm paying for an app that should tell me what to do but I'm doing the research myself.

Interviewer: What would help?

Kevin: A quiz that takes 2 minutes and gives me ONE program. "Based on your goals and experience, do this program." Not 50 options. Also, videos of how to do the exercises. The app just has text descriptions and tiny diagrams. I need to see someone actually doing a Romanian deadlift.

Interviewer: Anything that surprised you positively?

Kevin: The timer between sets is nice. And tracking my weights is easy. The core functionality is fine, it's just getting started that's the problem. First week is make-or-break and you're throwing everything at new users.
