Interviewer: You're one of our top sellers. What's working and what's frustrating?

Aisha: Honestly, I'm considering leaving. The fees keep going up and I'm getting less value. When I started three years ago, fees were 10%. Now they're 20% plus payment processing. That's almost a quarter of my revenue.

Interviewer: What would justify those fees?

Aisha: Better clients. Right now I spend HOURS filtering through garbage requests. "Can you design a logo for $20?" or people who want unlimited revisions. I'm a professional, I've been doing this for 12 years. Match me with serious clients.

Interviewer: Have you tried the "Pro" tier matching?

Aisha: It's a joke. I pay extra for "premium leads" and half of them are the same low-budget clients. The algorithm doesn't understand quality. It just matches keywords. My portfolio has Fortune 500 work and I'm getting matched with people selling t-shirts on Etsy.

Interviewer: What would make you stay?

Aisha: Show me you're working for ME, not just taking my money. Verified client budgets. Escrow that actually works - I've had two clients disappear after I delivered work. And for god's sake, let me filter out clients below a certain budget. I shouldn't have to click into every request to see they want to pay $50 for a brand identity.

Interviewer: Anything else?

Aisha: Portfolio presentation is terrible. I upload beautiful work and it gets compressed into blurry thumbnails. First impressions matter in design. You're hurting my business.
