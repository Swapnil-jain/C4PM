Interviewer: What are you hearing from customers like this fintech?

Mike: They're about to churn. I've had three escalation calls this quarter. The VP Engineering is frustrated, the Product Director is frustrated, even the analysts are complaining.

Interviewer: What's the main ask?

Mike: It depends who you ask. Engineering wants security, Product wants speed, Analysts want a redesign. They all think their thing is most important.

Interviewer: If you could only fix one thing?

Mike: Honestly? Security. If they churn because of a failed audit, we lose the account completely. Speed and design are frustrations - security is existential. But don't tell the Product Director I said that.

Interviewer: Any other patterns you're seeing?

Mike: This isn't unique. Half our enterprise accounts have the same split - technical leaders worry about security, business leaders worry about speed, end users want UX. We need to figure out who to listen to.
