Interviewer: What's your main pain point with our product?

Emma: Speed. Everything is too slow. Dashboards take 10 seconds to load. Reports take minutes. My team wastes hours waiting for data.

Interviewer: How does this affect your work?

Emma: We've stopped using real-time data for decisions. By the time I get the numbers, they're stale. I'm making decisions based on yesterday's data because today's data is still loading.

Interviewer: What would fix this?

Emma: Whatever it takes. I'd pay 2x for a product that's instant. Speed is the killer feature you're missing.
