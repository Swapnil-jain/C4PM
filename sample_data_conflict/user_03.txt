Interviewer: What's frustrating about the product?

Lisa: The interface is from 2010. I spend my day in this tool and it's ugly and clunky. Buttons are in weird places, the color scheme hurts my eyes, nothing is intuitive.

Interviewer: How does this affect your productivity?

Lisa: I'm slower than I should be. I know where everything is now, but it took months to learn. New team members struggle for weeks. We've lost two hires who said "I can't work with this tool."

Interviewer: What would you prioritize?

Lisa: A redesign. Make it beautiful and intuitive. I'd love to actually enjoy using this product instead of dreading it every morning.
