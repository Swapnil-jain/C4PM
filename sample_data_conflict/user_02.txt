Interviewer: What's your main concern with our product?

James: Security. We had an audit last month and three findings came from your product. Insecure API endpoints, missing encryption at rest, no audit logging.

Interviewer: How serious are these findings?

James: Our CISO is threatening to pull the plug. We handle financial data - we can't have security gaps. I've been fighting to keep you as a vendor but I'm running out of excuses.

Interviewer: What would fix this?

James: Fix the security issues. I don't care about new features. Don't touch anything else. Just make it secure. We'll deal with slow dashboards - we can't deal with a data breach.
