Interviewer: You signed up last month. How's it going?

Alex: I almost gave up on day one. Getting from "I have an API key" to "I made my first successful call" took me four hours.

Interviewer: What was difficult?

Alex: The quickstart guide assumes I already know things I don't. It says "set up authentication" and links to a page with five different auth methods. Which one do I use? For a side project, I just want the simplest thing that works. Don't make me read about OAuth vs API keys vs service accounts.

Interviewer: Did you reach out for help?

Alex: I tried Discord but it's overwhelming. Thousands of messages, no search that works, and the "help" channel is just people asking questions with no answers. I found a tutorial on YouTube that was more helpful than your official docs.

Interviewer: What would have helped?

Alex: A "I'm a beginner, just show me the code" button. Copy-paste code that works. Not "here's the concept of authentication" - just give me the curl command and the Python equivalent. I'll learn the concepts later when I care.

Interviewer: What about the free tier?

Alex: The free tier is so limited it's almost useless for learning. 100 API calls per day? I burn through that in 20 minutes of testing. By the time I figure out what I'm doing, I'm locked out until tomorrow. Either give me enough calls to learn or don't bother having a free tier.
